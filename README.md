This repository contains two machine learning projects developed using Python.


1. Eye Image Classification
   
This project classifies eye images as either "open" or "closed". The dataset contains images of eyes in both states. The workflow involves:

KNN Classifier: Initially, the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm is used to classify the images and calculate the prediction accuracy.

HOG Feature Extraction: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction is applied to the images, and the classification accuracy is calculated again,     showing an improvement over the initial method.

2. Linear Regression Model Analysis
   
This project performs a detailed data analysis on a model trained using linear regression techniques. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
